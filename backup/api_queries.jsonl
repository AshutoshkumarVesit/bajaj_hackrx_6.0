This includes:\n   - **Medical Equipment**: More advanced medical equipment, such as MRI machines, CT scanners, and specialized diagnostic tools.\n   - **Facilities**: Larger operating rooms, intensive care units (ICUs), and other critical facilities.\n   - **Technology**: Advanced communication systems, electronic health records (EHRs), and digital imaging technologies.\n\n3. **Specialized Services**: Hospitals in towns often provide more specialized services due to the lower population size. This includes:\n   - **Specialty Care**: More intensive care units for patients with specific medical conditions.\n   - **Emergency Services**: Enhanced emergency response capabilities, including advanced trauma centers (ATCs) and rapid response teams.\n\n4. **Financial Considerations**: Hospitals in towns may have higher costs due to the lower population size, but they are still able to provide adequate services under this policy.\n\n5. **Regulatory Compliance**: The regulatory environment for hospitals can vary significantly between metropolitan areas and towns with less than 1 million people.
